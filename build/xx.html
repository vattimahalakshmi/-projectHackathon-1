        TIPS
       </b> </h1>

    <body style="background-color:#FBACAC;"> 
        <h3><b>Are you having a bad period day.</b></h3>
         <H3><b>Are you late for a meeting or stressed about your period ruining your special days 
            here are some tips. </b></H3>
        </P>
        <li><b>Tip #1: Limit Sugar, Alcohol, and Caffeine</b></li>
        <p>During the menstrual cycle, hormones fluctuate and with that so do our emotions, Our appetite,Our thoughts, Our well-being. 
            One way to promote hormonal balance is to limit sugar, alcohol, and caffeine during your cycle.
             In addition, limiting these things can help reduce cramping as they have been found to actually trigger cramps during menstruation.
        </p>
        <li><b>Tip #2: Eating Whole Foods Every 3-4 Hours</b></li>
         <p>  Mood swings during your cycle can also be due to cortisol spikes. Cortisol is an important hormone that works with your brain in order to regulate things such as mood.
             To avoid these mood swings, try to eat every 3-4 hours. Eating more frequent smaller meals, focusing on whole foods, could help regulate cortisol levels in your body and thus help avoid mood swings. 
            Try this, and you may find yourself not bouncing like a yo-yo between emotions and energy levels quite so much. </p>

        <li><b>Tip #3: Drink Herbal Tea</b></li>
         <p>  If you do experience painful cramping, one tip is to drink herbal tea. Examples would be chamomile, ginger, and dandelion.
             All of these herbs are shown to help with inflammation and can help reduce pain. So whenever you feel a cramp coming on, brew yourself a nice cup of herbal tea… mmmm.
            </p>
             <li><b>Tip #4: Increase Iron Intake</b></li>
            <p> Around 1mg of iron is said to be lost every day blood loss occurs; a significant amount of iron (6-11% of the body's needs).
                 Any loss needs to be accounted for! Eating foods such as dark leafy greens (spinach) and red meats, liver, lentils, and fortified foods is imperative. 
                 Pair these foods with vitamin C (oranges, strawberries, etc.) to help with iron absorption!
                </p>
                <li><b>Tip #5: Magnesium Rich Foods</b></li>
                   <p>To help with fatigue, eat foods rich in magnesium. These foods include spinach, pumpkin seeds, bananas, almonds, and dark chocolate. 
                    These delicious foods can be your first step in fighting fatigue associated with the later phase of your cycle.</p>
                 <li><b>#6: Get your body moving</b></li>
                   <p> Exercising while on period releases endorphins in the body that help in combating mood swings.
                     It also increases blood flow which eases out menstrual cramps, making you feel even better.</p>

                     <li><b>#7: Drink lots of water</b></li>
<p>This is the easiest hack you can try. Staying hydrated will keep your bloating at bay. Ensure that you drink at least 8 to 9 glasses of water. Consuming warm water will also help with your period cramps by increasing the blood flow and relaxing the cramped muscle.
</p>
<li><b>#8: You can have your favourite bar of dark chocolate</b></li>
<p>
Haven’t we already told you that having dark chocolate is actually healthy? Chocolate that is high in cocoa content not only helps in period cramps but it also has other benefits. It can help you relieve the stress and combat the monstrous mood swings, all at once!

Dark chocolates contain sugar which can help increase the serotonin levels. It is the same hormone responsible for stabilizing your mood and inducing a feeling of happiness.?</p>
